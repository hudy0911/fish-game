# Room Market

The Room Market lets Parti web load online room templates published by the community on
GitHub — no manual zip downloads or repository URLs needed. This document is written for
**room authors / AI agents** who want to publish a game, and for maintainers who review
submissions.

## 1. How it works

The market combines an "issue registry + repository files" structure, built entirely on
public GitHub facilities and the jsdelivr CDN — no extra server-side service:

```
[Author repo alice/game-a]                   [Parti main repo glink25/Parti]
  Repository files (root or a subdirectory)    Issues
  ├─ parti.room.json  ─┐                       [parti-room] alice/game-a
  ├─ index.html        │ triage embeds in body labels: parti-room, beta, recommend
  └─ room.worker.js    ▼                       body: <!-- parti-room:manifest --> block
  Release (manual fallback)
  ├─ parti.room.zip    ← download, then import from ZIP
  └─ parti.room.json
```

- **Registry = the Parti main repo's issue tracker.** An author files an issue in the
  required format; the triage workflow verifies the room package in the author's
  repository, embeds the manifest into the issue body's marker block, and applies the
  `parti-room` label — the room is listed.
- **Listing data = the issues API response** (the manifest rides along in `body` for
  free — one request, and no dependence on GitHub release downloads, which lack CORS
  headers). Listings are sorted by comment count in descending order by default.
- **Card ID = the registry issue number.** Share links use
  `#/editor/market/<issueNumber>`. The web app fetches that card through GitHub's
  single-issue API, pins it, then loads and deduplicates the normal paginated list.
  Closed, unlabelled, or missing issues are reported as unavailable shared rooms.
- **Install = reading the author's repository files via jsdelivr**:
  `data.jsdelivr.com` lists the file tree, `cdn.jsdelivr.net` serves each file — CORS
  enabled and no GitHub API quota consumed.
- **`parti.room.zip` in a release = manual fallback.** The static web app cannot
  reliably read GitHub Release assets across origins, so release assets are never an
  automatic install source. Users download the ZIP and then use "Import from ZIP".
- Triage really downloads and parses the ZIP with the same resolver used by the web app.
  If the git ref is incomplete but the ZIP is valid, the entry is listed as "ZIP only".
- **Closing the issue delists the room.** Copies already installed in a user's browser
  are unaffected.

User flow: create-room page → the "Room Market" tab lists published rooms (cover, name,
description, beta/recommended badges) → click "Install" → the package is fetched via
jsdelivr, validated, and stored locally → create a room exactly like any imported
template. Players joining the room still receive the room code from the host over P2P
and never touch the market.
Users can also select a market card and use its top-right share button to copy a link
and invoke the browser Web Share dialog.

## 2. Publishing guide (authors / AI agents)

### 2.1 Prepare the room package

Finish the room's three core files per [getting-started.md](./getting-started.md) and
verify them locally:

- `parti.room.json` — the manifest; fields and validation in [manifest.md](./manifest.md)
- UI entry (e.g. `index.html`)
- Worker entry (e.g. `room.worker.js`; must be a single file with no relative imports)
- Any static assets (images/audio/styles for `packageMode: "filesystem"`)

### 2.2 Commit the room package to the repository (required)

Installation reads repository files directly, so **the repository must contain the
complete room package**:

- At the repository **root**, or inside a **subdirectory** (e.g. `dist/`);
- The directory must contain `parti.room.json` and every file declared in the manifest
  `entry`;
- If multiple `parti.room.json` files exist, triage checks them from shallowest to
  deepest and selects the first directory whose manifest is valid and whose declared
  entry files all exist. A manifest-only `public/` directory cannot hide a complete
  `dist/` package in the same repository.

Two common shapes:

| Shape | How |
| --- | --- |
| Plain HTML/JS room (no build) | Put the three files at the repository root and push to the default branch |
| Room with a build step | Use GitHub Actions to publish `dist/` to a dedicated `parti-package` branch and create a Release; pin the issue title with `@parti-package` (Appendix A) |

Cover (optional): the manifest `cover` may be an absolute URL or a package-relative path
(e.g. `"cover.png"`); market cards resolve it against the package directory.

### 2.3 Build the release assets (recommended manual fallback)

The release ZIP is an archive and manual-import fallback; the static web app does not
unpack it automatically. From the package directory:

```bash
cd dist   # or your package directory
zip -r ../parti.room.zip .
cd ..
cp dist/parti.room.json ./parti.room.json
```

Create a release and upload two assets: `parti.room.zip` and `parti.room.json`
(identical to the one inside the zip). The `parti.room.zip` must import successfully
via "Import from ZIP" in Parti web.

### 2.4 File the registry issue

In [glink25/Parti's issue tracker](https://github.com/glink25/Parti/issues), submit with
the **"Publish a room / 发布房间到市场"** template:

- Title (the template pre-fills the prefix): `[parti-room] <owner>/<repo>`
  - Example: `[parti-room] alice/game-a`
  - Pin a git ref: `[parti-room] alice/game-a@parti-package`. A dedicated
    `parti-package` branch is recommended for built rooms; without `@ref`, the default
    branch is used.
  - Release fallback follows the ref kind: the default branch or an explicit branch
    such as `parti-package` uses the latest release; an explicit tag such as `v1.2.0`
    only accepts the release with that same tag.
- Fill in the repository URL, a short game description, player counts, etc.

### 2.5 Review and labels

- Triage uses the same resolver as the web app for both the git ref and Release ZIP. It
  embeds the manifest, versioned source metadata, and a clickable link to the resolved
  source branch/directory in the issue body.
- A complete git package is listed with one-click installation. If only the Release ZIP
  passes, the entry is listed as "ZIP only". If both fail, the `parti-room` label is removed.
- On failure it comments with the reason; after fixing, **edit the issue** (any small
  change) to re-trigger the check.
- A maintainer may replace `beta` with `recommend` after a manual review.
- Label semantics:

| Label | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `parti-room` | Listing gate. Only open issues with this label appear in the market |
| `beta` | Shows a "Beta" badge — the room may be incomplete or unstable |
| `recommend` | Shows a "Recommended" badge — quality acknowledged by maintainers |

If an issue has both `beta` and `recommend`, its card only shows the higher-priority
"Recommended" badge.

### 2.6 Updates and delisting

- **Update**: when the issue is not pinned, push to the default branch (takes effect
  within jsdelivr's branch cache of a few hours); when pinned, cut a new tag and edit
  the issue title to point at it. After updating, **edit the issue once** so triage
  refreshes the embedded manifest. Users who already installed can click "Reinstall".
- **Delist**: close the registry issue. Installed local copies remain but the room
  disappears from the market.

### 2.7 Publishing checklist

- [ ] The repository contains `parti.room.json` and all files declared in `entry`; the room plays correctly
- [ ] Manifest `id`, `name`, `version`, `description` are filled in (shown in the listing)
- [ ] (Optional) `cover` points to a cover image inside the package or an absolute URL
- [ ] (Recommended) The release contains `parti.room.zip` / `parti.room.json`, and the zip imports via "Import from ZIP"
- [ ] Issue title matches `[parti-room] owner/repo` (or `...@ref`)
- [ ] After triage passes, the `parti-room:manifest` marker block in the issue body is kept intact

## 3. Appendix A: Recommended GitHub Actions publishing workflow

For rooms with a build step, a `v*` tag builds once, then updates the dedicated
`parti-package` branch for one-click installation and creates or updates a Release with
the ZIP/manual fallback assets. Register with `[parti-room] owner/repo@parti-package`.
Triage treats that branch as a rolling install source and validates the latest versioned
Release as its fallback; no Release named `parti-package` is needed.

```yaml
name: release
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  package:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      # Install dependencies and build; output goes to dist/
      - run: npm ci && npm run build
      - name: Package parti.room.zip
        working-directory: dist
        run: zip -r "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/parti.room.zip" .
      - name: Create release and upload archive assets
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          cp dist/parti.room.json parti.room.json
          if gh release view "$GITHUB_REF_NAME" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            gh release upload "$GITHUB_REF_NAME" parti.room.zip parti.room.json --clobber
          else
            gh release create "$GITHUB_REF_NAME" parti.room.zip parti.room.json \
              --title "$GITHUB_REF_NAME" --generate-notes
          fi
      - name: Publish dist/ to the parti-package branch
        run: |
          publish_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
          cp -R dist/. "$publish_dir/"
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git checkout --orphan parti-package-publish
          git rm -rf . >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
          cp -R "$publish_dir/." .
          git add -A
          git commit -m "parti package $GITHUB_REF_NAME"
          git push -f origin HEAD:parti-package
```

Plain HTML/JS rooms (output equals source) don't need this workflow: keep the three
files on the default branch.

## 4. Appendix B: Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| Market card shows "Package info not written yet" | Triage hasn't run or its check failed: read the issue comments; fix and edit the issue to re-trigger |
| Market card shows "Package info invalid" | The embedded manifest is not valid JSON or fails validation (see [manifest.md](./manifest.md)) |
| Installation says the registered package directory is missing a file | The issue contains a stale package directory or the committed build is incomplete. Push the complete package and edit the issue to rerun triage. This is unrelated to the release ZIP contents |
| Install fails with "Failed to download the room package" | The repository is private or a single file exceeds jsdelivr's 20MB limit; download the release ZIP and import it manually |
| Install fails with "GitHub API rate limit reached" | The default-branch lookup call was throttled (60/hour/IP); retry later or use the card's "Download in browser" + "Import from ZIP" |
| Cover image doesn't show | Relative `cover` paths resolve against the package directory — commit the image next to the manifest, or use an absolute URL |
| Content didn't change after an update | jsdelivr caches branch refs for hours; pin a tag for immutable content. Also edit the issue once to refresh the embedded manifest |
| Card shows "ZIP only" | The git ref is incomplete but the Release ZIP passed. Publish `dist/` to `parti-package` and update the issue to `@parti-package` to restore one-click installation |
| Issue never gets listed | Neither the git ref nor Release ZIP passed triage (see the comments), or a maintainer removed the `parti-room` label |
| Market list fails to refresh | Unauthenticated GitHub API rate limit; try later — the page falls back to cached content |

## 5. Security and limitations

- Room UI runs in a `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` iframe; room logic runs
  in a Web Worker in the host's browser. The sandbox does not block network requests
  (subject to browser CORS), so **only install sources you trust** and prefer rooms with
  the `recommend` badge.
- The `beta` badge means the room has not been fully tested; gameplay or stability may
  be rough.
- The market list is cached for 10 minutes; click "Refresh" to force an update. jsdelivr
  additionally caches branch refs for hours.
- Private repositories cannot be read by jsdelivr; the market only supports public
  repositories. Single files over 20MB cannot be distributed via jsdelivr.

## 6. Maintainer guide

- **Listing**: normally handled by `.github/workflows/room-issue-triage.yml` (verify the
  repository package → embed the manifest in the body → label). To list manually, verify
  the title format and the repository package, paste the manifest into the body as a
  ` ```parti.room.json ` fenced block (the web app parses it as a fallback), then apply
  the `parti-room` label.
- **Quality tiers**: after actually playing the room, remove `beta` and apply
  `recommend`; for problematic rooms, remove `parti-room` (temporary delist) or close
  the issue (permanent delist).
- **Abuse**: close the issue and follow GitHub's standard reporting flow for malicious
  publishers.
